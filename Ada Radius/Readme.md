Rigged Mesh Avatars and Clothing

Armature to add to a Blender avatar mesh... 

 * For making Ruth2 'fitted' clothing, e.g. weighting to the volume bones, use avatar_skeleton_customproperties.blend
 * If using the Ruth2 mesh for something else, such as shrinking to make a tiny human, then use avatar_skeleton.xml(FemaleArmature).blend and change the names of the vertex groups to the equivalent mBones.

Simple sample avatar mesh: SLAvatar.blend

Guidance notes: Export_ImportRiggedMeshBlender.md

The opensim_armatures.ods spreadsheet is an analysis by Ada Radius of Linden Lab's avatar_skeleton.xml cross-referenced to SLWiki information (some of which is wrong), the calculations converting the Maya values to Blender, and notes on exporting from Blender.
