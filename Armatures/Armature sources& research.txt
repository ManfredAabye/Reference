you should get an identity matrix if you do joint-matrix * bind-matrix.

    The Restpose is where all pose matrices are neutral have no influence on the skeleton and the meshes
    The Bindpose is an arbitrary pose that is treated as if it where the restpose.
But Blender does not have a bind pose, or better said, In Blender the Bindpose and the Restpose are always identical.

The bind pose is the inverse of the transformation matrix of the bone, when the bone is in the bind pose.

Animated COLLADA files provide the following info Skin - bind shape matrix - list of joint/weight index pairs - list of weights - list of joint nodes used during skinning - list of inverse bind matrices, one per joint and the animation channel (track) data.

for(bone in bones) 
  localMatrix = calculateMatrix(bone.rotation, bone.position)
  if(bone is root)
    bone.worldMatrix = localMatrix
  else
    bone.worldMatrix = bone.parent.worldMatrix * localMatrix
  bone.inverseBindpose = invert(bone.worldMatrix)
  bone.offsetMatrix = bone.inverseBindpose * bone.worldMatrix

Blender manual:
The new option Keep Bind Info checks each bone for having two arrays:
    rest_mat – an array of 16 floats which represent the bone’s original rest-pose matrix.
    bind_mat – an array of 16 floats which represent the bone’s original bind-pose matrix.
    Those two arrays can later be used when you want to export the rig again and be sure the original rest pose/bind pose combination must be used.

Back in 2.70 this issue was solved in a very ugly way:

we added a custom transformation to each bone which contains a scale, a rotation and a translation:

restpose_scale_x (default = 1.0)
restpose_scale_y (default = 1.0)
restpose_scale_z (default = 1.0)

restpose_rot_x (default = 0.0)
restpose_rot_y (default = 0.0)
restpose_rot_z (default = 0.0)

restpose_loc_x (default = 0.0)
restpose_loc_y (default = 0.0)
restpose_loc_z (default = 0.0)
...
So i proceed as follows now:

    I add the code for creating the custom properties to the Collada importer
    I add an option to the importer to "import bind pose info"
    I also add a new option to the exporter "use custom bind pose"
