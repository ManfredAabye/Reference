---- Maya Bento Aimation Instructions ---
1.  To animate the entire avatar in 3D space move and key the humanIK1 . 
2.  You can find the "humanIK1" in the Outliner.
3.  Before you export your BVH file you must have the mPelvis bone selected.

(NOTE: The Bento Animation Skeleton has extra bones that are not apart
of the normal SL skeleton.  These bones have the word "Effector" in
their names.  They are needed so the BVH exporter can export properly.
DO NOT rig to them.)

(NOTE: The Bento Animation Skeleton Maya must be set to Y up Axis.  If
you open the "Maya Bento Testing Animation Skeleton.ma" and it is on
its side you have Z up Axis set and need to set Y up in your
"Preferences".)

(NOTE: DO NOT IMPORT "Maya Bento Testing Animation Skeleton.ma" into
an already open scene.  Importing any file that contains a skeleton
always changes the names of all the bones in that file by adding the
name of the imported file to the beginning of each bone name.  The
wrong bone names will cause the SL upload window to reject the BVH
file.)
