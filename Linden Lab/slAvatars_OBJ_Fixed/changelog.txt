Persuant to the terms of the Creative Commons license, under which Linden Lab has made the Second Life Avatar Contant Creation Aids available, the following changes are hereby identified:

- Pre-existing separate meshes are now combined into single meshes for each avatar body.
- UV maps for each body section (head, upperbody, lowerbody) are now arranged in separate UV tiles, to best facilitate use with 3D paint programs, such as Mudbox, Zbrush, Photoshop Extended, etc.
- Normals have been unlocked, and all edge normals have been softened.
- Pre-existing JPG texture files are not included, and references to them have been removed.
- Eyes, hair, and skirt meshes are not included.
